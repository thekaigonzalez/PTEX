ADDRESSING "warning: null line" warnings!!!

"null line" occurs when a line has been having trouble being read.
the "null line" issue usually doesn't affect compile performance, but more
of the code quality.

"null line" isn't serious, and most files will get the warning due to invalid line endings.
